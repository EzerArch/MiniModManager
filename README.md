This software blocks files that should not be loaded by Minecraft Forge Loader (MFL) by renaming them to an non-supported file extension.

A config file is read to filter out the files that must be loaded while unwanted files will be skipped.

Among other benefits, the user will no longer need to move jar and zip files from the 'mods' folder every time he/she needs to start MC up in a different mod environment.

Minor features: direct access to the main Minecraft directories, such as 'saves', 'mods', 'config'. No need to go thought %appdata% thing in the Explorer/file manager.

No UI, sorry. Command line FTW! It's meant to be light and fast, especially for people who need to test tons of mods and launch MC on different mod setups.
